Welcome to the AutomA project documentation site. You'll find a wealth of information in the following sections:
- [User Guide](/user_guide/index.html) which will help you get to grips with our software,
- [Developer documentation](/developers_documentation/index.html) aimed at developers and anyone wishing to contribute to Github projects,
- [Deployment guide](/deploy_guide/index.html) which will help you install our software.

## The project

This project is aimed particularly, but not exclusively, at system and network administrators, CISOs and anyone wishing to improve the security of their infrastructures. We initiated this project following the observation that hardening machines is time-consuming in many companies, and that it's not always easy to apply hardening rules.

This project is available under the MIT license.

## References

The French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) is made up of experts, particularly in operating system hardening. We therefore chose ANSSI as the first repository for our hardening actions. Of course, we'd like to propose other standards such as CIS. If you would like to suggest other standards to add, please contact us at the following e-mail address [automa.project@proton.me](mailto:automa.project@proton.me).
